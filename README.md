# maze
 Maze generation with prim's algorithm and solving with dijkstra's.

## Controls
 WASD - Movement (Player is pink)

 R - Regenerate

 V - Visualize the dijkstra's algorithm (slightly broken at the moment, only use before moving)

 T - Show correct path

 E - Restart (with current maze)

Note: diagonal movement skips the tile, so it is possible to move past the goal if vertical and horizontal movement keys are pressed at the same time.
